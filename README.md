### Hi there, I'm Chelsea (she/they) ðŸ‘‹

My fascination for statistics and pattern recognition has driven me to develop my skills in data collection, statistical programming, and interpretation. My first coding love lies with RStudio -- from the interface down to the code, it was the first language I picked up quickly. I'm currently working on learning Python and HTML so as to give me more freedom within my projects. 

I graduated May 2021 Magna Cum Laude from San Francisco State University. I hold a BS in Statistics with an emphasis in Science. I am here to build my portfolio in order to show case my code but I'm also here to show you a bit of who I am and what I am interested in. I am also here to network with like-minded data analysts, machine-learners, and decision scientists, whoever you may be! 

If you like what you see here and would like to discuss my projects, your projects, or to collaborate on one, feel free to send me an email at chelsea.miranda.lancaster@gmail.com or connect with  me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelsea-m-lancaster/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin"><span class="label">Linkedin</span></a>.
